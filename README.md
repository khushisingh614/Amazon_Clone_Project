# Amazon Clone - HTML/CSS Learning Project

The Amazon Clone project is a beginner-friendly learning project that aims to provide hands-on experience in HTML and CSS by recreating a simplified version of the popular e-commerce platform, Amazon. This project helps me to learn the fundamental concepts of web development and gain practical skills in structuring web pages, styling elements, and creating responsive layouts using HTML and CSS alone.
This project mimics the layout of Amazon's homepage, complete with the Amazon logo, navigation bar, search bar, and a selection of product categories.
